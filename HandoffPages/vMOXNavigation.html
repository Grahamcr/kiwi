  <p class="light-content vmox bm-0 tm-0">Created June 15 2018</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Was designed to reinforce micro site mental model and is based on our card sort study results, which can be found at <a href="https://obyzb2.axshare.com/#g=1" target="_blank">vMOX Card Sort Study Results</a></li>
      <li>Users will be directed to their role's microsite upon log in and have the ability to navigate to other microsites as needed.</li>
      <li>Mockup can be viewed at: <a href="https://xmpmxv.axshare.com/start.html#p=iteration_1&g=1&fn=0" target="_blank">vMOX Navigation 2.0 Mockup</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <p class="light-content larger vmox">Based on the results of the <a href="https://obyzb2.axshare.com/#g=1" target="_blank">vMOX Navigation Card Sort Study</a> we determined that most of our users would organize the navigation options based by role.  This suggested that users would relate to a microsite layout where the user is directed to a role-based experience upon log in. In order to support this we needed to develop a new navigation scheme that seperates the different roles into their own microsites. </p>
  
  <h3 class="vmox bm-0">Style Suggestions</h3>
  <hr class="vMOX tm-0"/>
  
  <p class="light-content larger vmox">The vMOX Navigation 2.0 header has two different views: Microsite Homepages and Microsite Content Pages.  The first view we will cover is the Microsite Homepage, which is the view the user will be presented with when they are on the homepage for a particular role. </p>
  
  
  <p class="light-content larger vmox">The homepage view has a banner that is 50% image and 50% banner, followed by a navigation bar located directly below the banner.  The number of links displayed in the navigation bar is determined by the amount of horizontal space it has been allocated by the viewport. Navigation links should always be evenly spaced at 135 pixels apart.  Therefore the number of links which are displayed is determined by how many fit in the bar.  </p>

    <a href="https://xmpmxv.axshare.com/start.html#p=iteration_1&g=1&fn=0" target="_blank" class="vmox gold button medium">View Mockup</a>
  </div>
  
  <p class="light-content larger vmox">If there are more links then will fit in the navigation bar then those links are put into the &quot;More&quot; dropdown menu.  This menu is accessed by clicking on the &quot;More&quot; which acts as a toggle (both hiding and showing the menu).  If the user selects a link in the &quot;More&quot; menu then &quot;More&quot; becomes bold and underlined in the Navigation Bar and the link selected in the &quot;More&quot; menu is also bolded and underlined.  </p>
