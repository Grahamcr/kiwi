  <h4 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">What Did Design Do This Week?</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communications Management - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I completed the first iteration of the Communications Management onboarding and approval process mockup.  This functionality will allow our customers to self-enroll in the various reports we offer and provide valuable visibility into their devices, usage and cost. On Friday I met with the Amigos and discussed the mockup in detail.  Several impactful decisions were made which will result in the need to go back and create a second iteration of the management mockup.  The primary changes to be made are the custom email page.  In the first iteration we had only two choices and required a waiting period, the second iteration has three options and no waiting period.  You can find the first iteration mockup of that page at&#58; <a href="https://ony9kb.axshare.com/#p=custom_email_switch_page_1&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Custom Email Page, Iteration One</a> and the second iteration of the page at&#58; <a href="https://ony9kb.axshare.com/#g=2&p=custom_email_switch_page&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Custom Email Page, Iteration Two</a>.   More changes to come early next week! </p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Project Kiwi - colors page - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I got the colors page to a functional state.  It isn't pretty yet but all the content is there if you have any questions about which colors to use while developing for vMOX.  You can access the page here: <a href="https://grahamcr.github.io/kiwi/StyleGuide/Colors.html" target="_blank"> Kiwi Color Style Guide Page</a></p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX and Advantage backend redesign - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Thanks again to everyone who participated in the card sort activity!  Craig presented the vMOX findings this week and it helped to drive important decisions about the navigation scheme.  It took longer to get data on the Advantage side so I just started to analyze the results but so far they are consistent with vMOX. Here again are the vMOX results: <a target="_blank" href="https://obyzb2.axshare.com/#g=1&p=high_level_takeaways">vMOX Card Sort Study Results</a>.  Craig and I met with the Amigos to discuss the results and several decisions we made.  Based the results it was concluded that goal of our redesign is to eventually break out the navigation structure into different microsites that all wrap up to a parent navigation bar.  In other words, if you work for sales you would log in and find that you are redirected to vmox-portal.com/sales and are presented with a navigation structure which only includes links relevant to your job responsibilities.  If you, as a sales person, need to see something from operations you would go up one level to the parent and then navigate back down to the Procurement microsite. </p>
  
  
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">Upcoming Efforts</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communications Management - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Next week I will be continuing to make changes to the Communications mockup based on the feedback from the meeting Friday.  Once those changes are complete I will bring the design back to the Amigos for approval and then start developing Kiwi pages for the content to prepare the design for handoff. </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">A effort that will probably not start next week, but is coming soon is the Employee Data Upload in OnePortal. Matt is busy getting the requirements together to hand off for next design sprint.  </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX and Advantage backend redesign - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Craig and I are going to redesign the menu based on the decisions made about navigation.  Then he will update the mockup of the vMOX menu.  I am going to finish analyzing the Advantage card sort results and create a mockup of that menu.  The menu is the first step in a complete backend redesign for both companies. </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Project Kiwi - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">I am working primarily on two things with Kiwi.  The first is developing pages so that the content is accessible, even if the look and feel is not yet where I want it.  Next week I plan to create the text page which includes information on fonts, headings, etc.  I am also still working on the Axure mockup to finalize the design. </p>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Meg)</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Since I have color on the brain this week, here are interesting UX facts about color.  Did you know that Google once tested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01marissa.html?pagewanted=3" target="_blank">41 shades of blue</a> for their links to find out which color people were most likely to click on?  You can read more about how to use color when designing here: <a target="_blank" href="https://uxplanet.org/color-theory-brief-guide-for-designers-76e11c57eaa">Intro to Color Theory</a> and here: <a target="_blank" href=""> Tips for choosing colors</a>. </p>

<p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Also, did you know that Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind?  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/20/the-face-of-facebook">He chose blue</a> for Facebook's primary color because it is the color that he can see best.  <a href="https://nei.nih.gov/health/color_blindness/facts_about" target="_blank">8% of men are red-green color blind</a> and it is an <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-easiest-part-about-designing-accessible-websites-76cd6b9a7ae4" target="_blank">important factor to consider when designing</a>. You can simulate different kinds of color blindness using <a href="http://colororacle.org/index.html" target="_blank">ColorOracle</a>; color contrast checkers can also be very helpful.
