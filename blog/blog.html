  <hr class="vMOX tm-0"/>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-70 bm-0">Our Design Approach 2.0</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">The Kiwi Design System</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Over the past two weeks we have a design team have been doing a lot of introspection hoping to gain some insight into how we can do a better job empowering the growing development team to create an intuitive, visually pleasing and consistent user experience across all of our products. The result of this exercise was a renewed commitment to a strategy we admittedly did not do a great job implementing after the completion of the initial Advantage Command Center Launch – creating a modular design library which we called Project Kiwi.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">While I believe that Kiwi has had some success at improving handoffs and design awareness, it has failed to create a consistent single source of truth that explicitly lays out our design philosophy.  To that end, I have proposed that we renew are Kiwi efforts and create a Design System. I Design System goes beyond what a design library is as it becomes its own project within an organization.  Well done Design Systems are centralized, strictly followed and comprehensive enough that developers, designers and quality assurance professionals can all rely on it to remove the vast majority of the design ambiguity they encounter.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Design Systems have become the standard as we moved into the next generation of the web and it is very common for companies to make their Design Systems publicly available.  If you are interested you can find a nice repository of design systems on Adele at: <a href="https://adele.uxpin.com/" target="_blank">Adele.com</a>.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">After speaking with Tim, Michael and Thomas, I put together a proposal for the Design System I would like to create for our organization.  You can find the proposal I pitched to Richard, Shelly and Matt at: <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=kiwii_thoughts&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Design System Proposal</a>. I am happy to say that as a design team, this is now the direction that we will be heading in and that we are already working on the practical implications of this proposal. </p>
  
  
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">Project Kiwi Design System ... uh ... er ... Design (I know it is pretty meta...)</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Meg spent a day this week creating what we would like the Design System Design to be like.  Our goal is focus on navigation and to make sure that it is as clear and quick as possible to get to the information you need.  To support these goals Meg settled on a very minimal design that puts the navigation cleanly stuck on the left and gives the content the rest of the viewport to breathe.  If you would like to view the mockup for this page you can find it at: <a href="https://id8fri.axshare.com/#g=2&p=with_our_powers_combined&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Project Kiwi Design System</a></p>

  </div>
  
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">Project Kiwi Component Library</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">We have also started a brand new Component Library that will support our renewed focus on a minimalist, vector-based interface.  This Axure library will be STRICTLY followed in our designs.  That is to say we will not allow ourselves to use a Component in a design if it is not already in the library and if we need a Component which is not in the library we will have to justify adding it to the library by proving that it will be used again. If you would like to view the Component Library you can find it at: <a href="https://ns4e3o.axshare.com/#g=1&p=standard_modal&fn=0" target="_blank">Kiwi Component Library</a></p>
  

  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">The Pattern Library (The Lego Instructions Pages</h5>
  
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">In addition to a Component Library, which defines the Atomic Level Components (commonly referred to as Lego Blocks in the biz…) we are also creating Design Pattern Templates for commonly encountered pages such Lists, Entity Details, Modals, Flyouts, Dashboards, etc.  These Design Patterns will help us establish a level of consistently we as a design team have so far failed to help establish and create a simpler and more enjoyable experience for our users going forward.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">We are currently in the process of generalizing our needs for each of these different pages, but we do have some progress to share with you.  The first Design Pattern we took on was a List Page.  In the animation below you can see how we have handled the standard data manipulation which takes place on a List as well as the addition of a Data Insights.  Data Insights are huge help to users has it helps them translate the data they are looking at into actionable information which we can use to drive desired user behavior and action.

  </div>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Our second Design Pattern will actually cover several different types of views which exist in the current iteration of the backend systems. Our Ref-Type view will have the flexibility to handle everything from the complex data structure that is a Customer to a simple entity such as Task.  This view is currently in-progress, but you are welcome to take an early preview at:  <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=ref_type_view&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Ref Type Design Pattern</a>.</p>

  </div>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">So what will this look like in practice?</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">I am glad you asked! We actually have a design that we created using the Design System as it exists already today.  The vMOX Prospect Onboarding Design was created using our minimalist, vector-based approach using only components from the Kiwi Component Library referenced above. The result is a design that leverages white space and small pops of color to create a pleasing visual experience while a simple navigation scheme lets the user quickly accomplish the primary task of uploading the data we need to conduct an initial assessment of their mobile environment.

  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Craig)</h4>
  
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">So you probably hear/read me ramble on and on about all the value that UX claims to bring to an organization and the products/offerings it creates.  You might have even heard how I believe that UX can even be used to improve experiences outside the digital realm (if you want proof just how much I believe that you should see Meg and I’s KanBan Board we use to prioritize our time outside of work). Between all the talk about Personas, User Goals, Qualitative Research and Mental Modals I have to believe that some of you still reasonably ask, What is this UX good for anyway? Who else believes that UX can be effective on this broad of a scope? Well I have an answer for you and that answer is Memes.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 bm-50 vmox">While looking for my typically weekly meme that I stick as an easter egg into the title of each of these blog posts I ran across an article with an interesting name: How to Make a Meme Go Virial with UX.  A quest someone took on to use UX research to quantify the audience required to make a Meme go virial, determine what that audience needs in a Meme and then to design a Meme based on those insights. It’s all a bit hilarious, but the writer does a great job at showing how the UX Double Diamond approach can be applied to just about anything. If you want to check the article out you can find it here: <a href="https://uxplanet.org/how-to-make-a-meme-go-viral-as-a-designer-f1cc425a8659" target="_blank">How to Make a Meme Go Viral with UX</a>.  O and the Meme that he created, it is terrifying, but it did become one of the top 20 posts within 24 hours.  Shield your eyes as you glance at it below. </p>

  <hr class="vMOX tm-0"/>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-70 bm-0">What Did Design Do On Vacation?</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">A Trip to the Paris Museum National D&#39;Histoire Naturelle</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">While we were on vacation we took our dinosaur loving three year old to a museum which had a special exhibit all about the only dinosaur that really matters to him, the Tyrannosaurus-Rex.  I expected to enter the exhibit and be instantly overwhelmed by boredom as we shuffled through a stuffy exhibit full of academic signs and roped off glass cases. However, my expectation as a user could not have been more wrong.  What we experienced instead was a collection of exhibits whose focus on Natural Mapping, Tone and effective Mental Models made for an amazingly fun and interactive visit. As a result I thought it might be fun to go through the UX of the exhibit that in my opinion made it so successful. </p>
    
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">T-Rex Bike Survival</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Ever wonder how you would fare if you were being chased by a hungry Tyrannosaurus-Rex? (which Hollywood leaves me to wonder if they were ever not hungry?).  One the exhibits we used let Finn and I find out.  The exhibit designers cleverly mapped my real world experience of riding a bike to the virtual one they created by positioning a stationary bike between two screens.  They then met my expected mental model by showing what was in front of me, behind me, in my mirrors, how far away the T-Rex was and how close the finish line was.  All together it created an very fun interaction which I can proudly say Finn and I survived.</p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">What if a T-Rex ate you?</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This might have been one of the more morbid exhibits, but the natural mapping done here was great.  The goal of the exhibit was to see how long a T-Rex could live if they ate you, or you and your family and friends.  The scale was huge, which easily suggested that I could get on it with the entire family.  Second the numbers going up mapped easily to the number of days the T-Rex would be full and I guess happy after eating me. In this case, I don&#39;t think the T-Rex would be all to happy for that long... </p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0" style="margin-top: 200px">Paint a T-Rex</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">According to the science folks at the Paris Natural History museum we have no idea what color scheme the T-Rex choose for their UI.  Therefore, the French thought it would be fun to let museum goers create their own versions of what a T-Rex might have looked like using a projector screen to colorize and accessorize a T-Rex.  All of that is nothing special, but what is special is how the decided to incorporate Natural Mapping into the controls for the interaction.</p>
  
   <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Instead of just pointing to a color and then rubbing the color on a stationary dinosaur, the designers opted to let the user paint with a spray paint can a &quot;restless&quot; T-Rex who moves around and reacts to what the user is doing.  Allowing the dinosaur to move around and adding different sound effects for each type of spray paint manufacturers a unique tone that invites the user to continue to interact with the exhibit in order to discover what else they can do.  </p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">Exhibit Placeholders</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Another cool approach to setting the tone of the exhibit was how the designers created video placeholders for each of the exhibits that had short audio/video clips of scientists explaining what the user what looking at.  Instead of just having a simple &quot; Press the button below to view this stereotypical boring academic lecture &quot; they recorded the scientist who would be presenting the information just hanging out waiting for someone to come by and interact with them.  The result is a room full of relatable looking people waiting around, checking their phones, looking at the ceiling, eating a snack, etc.  This creates a much more relatable tone since if I was stuck all day in a museum waiting to talk to be people to, that is what I would be doing as well.</p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">Projection Book</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The last exhibit in the hall was a large book that depicted what the scientists knew about the life of the T-Rex they had on display.  How they choose to display that information once again shows their attention to natural mapping, tone and mental models.  What they did was create a picture book of the T-Rex&#39;s life, which was an awesome choice, kids and parents alike love books.  Second what they did was reach their intended persona&#39;s love of interaction make the book have lots of animations and then project it onto an actual physical set of pages kids could turn.</p>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Over the last two weeks we have started a new effort: Expense Management for Advantage.

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This problem is complicated simply because invoices are complicated documents which vary from company to company and even charge type to charge type.

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 bm-250 vmox">One question or topic that we frequently address as Designers is how to create a usable and efficient data entry form.   I think a lot of the time we as humans look at a form and want to put it in columns because it feels balanced and as though it is a great use of space.  Multiple Column Layouts also track well with other experiences that we have: columned newspapers, articles, instruction manuals, etc.   However in reality UX Researchers (<a href="../img/blog/sep20/uxResearcher.png" target="_blank">Yup, that is actually a thing</a>) have found through various studies that the fastest form to fill out and the easiest to comprehend is a single column layout with one form description to one form input. It might feel like a waste of space, but laying out the form in a single column greatly reduces the possibility of user error as the single column layout makes it very clear which entry the user should move to next.

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">After receiving support from the Sales Team and vMOX Leadership we have been given the go ahead to start converting our Low Fidelity Sales Microsite Mockups (the ones that look like they were drawn by a <a href="../img/blog/sep7/chicken.gif" target="_blank">chicken</a>) to High Fidelity (the ones that look like they were composed by a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ux+unicorn&rlz=1C1GCEU_en&oq=ux+unicorn&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3408j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">unicorn</a>).  This basically means that we &quot;Get To&quot; start over and reconceptualize our designs based on the feedback we received from our Low Fidelity attempt.  The intent of this process is to produce very thoughtful and intuitive designs that flow together well since we already had an opportunity to design end-to-end once before (therefore we don’t design ourselves into a corner the second time through)</p>
    
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">We have already made some notable process with the Prospects area of the Microsite.  I have included some of the side-by-side changes for you to review below.

  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">Time Tracker PTO Request Issue Solution - Craig</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">I spend a little over a day this week developing a fix for an issue that existed in the Time Tracker PTO Request process.  The issue was that we were allowing employees to request more time off then would ever be possible for them to accrue throughout the year.  For example, lets say an employee has the ability to earn 100 hours of PTO a year.  Right now that employee could go into the system and make several PTO requests that total up more than 100 hours of PTO for the year. </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">To alleviate this confusion for the user I came up with a chart (which was modified by insight from Richard &amp; Rolando) which shows the user how much PTO they earn each year, how much they have taken so far this year and what the effect of their new PTO request will be.   You can find the Kiwi page for this design at: <a href="../HandoffPages/ttPTOFix.html" target="_blank">Time Tracker Fix Kiwi Page</a>. I have also included a screen shot of the different chart types we were considering when creating the design below:  </p>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">While converting our Sales Microsite Mockups to High Fidelity we realized that we were going to need a way of dynamically assigning a range of colors to an unknown number of widgets which would only be determined at runtime.  We didn’t want to create a bunch of constants, so Meg set out to come up with a more elegant solution.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Meg considered several different options, including variations of tone, opacity and hue.  However she ended up inventing a far better solution with...<a href="" target="_blank">analogous colors</a>! (I know try to contain your color wheels!).  Her solution was to take a range of analogous colors that were &qout;On-Brand&qout; and divide that range by the number of elements that we will need to color, such as bars in a bar graph or steps in a flow.  This solution is easy to calculate as all the developer needs to do is change one number in the rgb code by the step amount.  In addition this solution means that our range will always have the same difference between the start and the finish (since we always use the same start and finish rgb codes), which will be visually pleasing to the user.   You can view a copy of Meg’s research below:</p>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Another design that received support from vMOX leadership to move forward to High Fidelity was the RTMM Alerts for OnePortal (Check out previous blog posts for details).  Not much was changed in terms of functionality between the two, but hopefully you will be able to see how we were able to greatly improve the visual appearance of the design as we took it into High Fidelity. You can find the High Fidelity version of the mockup at: <a href="https://lklpy8.axshare.com/#g=1&p=final_iteration&c=1" target="_blank">RTMM Alerts Hi-Fi Mockup</a>.

  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Craig)</h4>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Beauty vs. Usability.  There is a fine line here.  As UX designers we try our best to make things beautiful, but often we risk getting pulled in too far to the point we the product suffers.  It is a struggle far older than the web, for example at one point in time, <a href="../img/blog/sep7/teapot.jpeg" target="_blank">this was a highly sought after product</a> because it was so beautiful. </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 bm-250 vmox">One example that I ran across lately of this struggle was a really awesome site for a museum that lets you control experience you see on your computer screen by swiping your phone.  The way it is set up is really quite neat.  Your phone turns into the map of the museum and your computer screen is your virtual view into the exhibits.  However, after using it a bit you quickly find out just how difficult it is to actually manage the two different experiences at once.  It is just one designer&#39;s opinion, but I think this one falls to heavy on the beauty side at the cost of the usability side (especially when you consider the accessibility of the experience).  If you want to try it out yourself visit: <a href="http://20.okeanelzy.com/en/" target="_blank">Okean Elzy</a>, follow the instructions on screen once it loads to pair your phone and your off to races!</p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">RTMM Alert PoC - Craig</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I started a new effort by creating an initial low fidelity mockup for the RTMM Alert Proof of Concept. This is an initiative that has sat around for a bit, but it has now entered the design process.  The goal of this effort is to bring visibility to the value that we are providing our customers (and prospective customers) through our alert features.  The mockup shows how we can group alerts by users so that the viewer will be able to quickly see who the most frequent overage offenders in their company are and then see if the alerts have had any effect on their behavior.  If you would like to view the mockup you can find it at: <a href="https://lklpy8.axshare.com/#g=1&p=design_a&c=1" target="_blank">RTMM Alert PoC</a>.</p>

  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Craig)</h4>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Abstracting/Reframing is a brainstorming tool that Meg and I both use a lot when we are developing designs for vMOX and Advantage.  The general idea behind the approach is to stop trying to solve the specific design problem you are facing and instead consider solving the larger problem it represents.  For example a lot of the time we will abstract a problem down to &quot;well this is just a categized table&quot; or this is &quot;just some form a newsfeed&quot;.  When we make that abstraction we then free ourselves to look for inspiration in examples that are not directly related to the types of designs that we create here at vMOX/Advantage.  It may sound silly, but so far we have found it to be a great way to come up with some really interesting &quot;Design B&#39;s&quot;.  By the way, Design B, would be an awesome name for a blog! </p>

   <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">Sales Microsite - Craig and Meg</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">For the past two weeks our primary focus as a design team has been on building out the Sale Microsite.  This is not a small task, but I am personally pretty proud of the progress we have made so far.  Since the sales microsite is huge I thought I would take a bit of a different approach this week and make a video of the progress we have made so far instead of making you read pages of boring UX specifics (this admittedly also lets me avoid writing those pages of UX explanation).  Therefore, without an further keystroke, here is the aforementioned video tour of the Sales Microsite Mockup. You can also view the mockup yourself at <a href="https://lqcx8s.axshare.com/#g=1&p=dashboard&fn=0" target="_blank">Sales Microsite Mockup</a>.</p>

  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Craig)</h4>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Lets talk about <a href="">Affordances</a>.  An Affordance descibles all actions that are made phiscally possible by the properties of the object itself (or an environment).  For example I bet at least some you tried to click on the word Affordance a couple of sentences back.  Why did you do that? Most likely you saw a blue underlined word and knew from your previous experiences that you should be able to click on it.  However, in that case you were lied to and it was a dead link (how frustrating right?).  Other examples that might come to mind which you might have come across in the physical world include door handles that suggest you should pull a door, or bottle caps which suggest you should twist them.</p>

  </div>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 bm-250 vmox">A recent pleasant encounter I had with well implemented Affordances is with my new pair of running shoes.  They have these great laces where all you have to do is push a tab in order to lace them, however then you are left with a large amount lace with nothing to do with it.  Naturally I went to go tuck that extra lace back under the lace itself only to find this tab on the tongue of the shoe waiting for me.  It was designed with a loop on the top suggesting that I should pull up on it, which then created a space for me to put my extra lace! Come on people, lets <a href="../img/blog/aug17/win.gif" target="_blank">celebrate the little victories in life</a>.</p>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Affordances are extremely powerful.  When they are correctly implemented they can effortlessly guide the user through your interface.  However when they are implemented incorrectly as with the lead link I introduced in the opening paragraph of this section, they can drive a user nuts.  This process of driving the user nuts with poorly implemented affordances is known as the difference between Perceived Affordance, what we think a object or element does and Actual Affordance, which is what the object is really capable of doing. </p>

This report is used in the contract we make with our customers to establish the baselines and thresholds that will be used to calculate savings (and therefore vMOX&#39;s earnings) for the life of the contract.  This was my first paper design while at vMOX and it brought with it the challenges of designing for greyscale and a 8.5 inch &quot;viewport&quot; if you will.

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">For the rest of this week my primary focus was requirements gathering and initial discovery for the next iteration of the vMOX WEM Sales Microsite.  This will be our first microsite design for the backend redesign effort and it’s a pretty big one.  To start things off Meg, Richard, Matt &amp; Myself all had a kickoff meeting where we agreed on the basic scope for the project, created the initial stories and dove into the basic requirements for the microsite homepage.  I then captured all of that information into a <a href="https://www.mindmeister.com/blog/ux-design-process-mind-maps/" target="_blank">Mind Map</a> that we can use to drive the architecture for our design. You can find a copy of that mind map below or your can view it at <a href="https://lqcx8s.axshare.com/#g=1&p=mind_map&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Sales Microsite Mind Map</a>.</p>

   <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The mind map does a great job at capturing the requirements of the dashboard, but it leaves out the human experience side which helps us to balance priority, needs and goals of the user with the limitations of the requirements and workspace we have been given.  Therefore, we need to create a persona that we can use to help us make those design priority decisions.  So, without further ado I present Sheldon, our Sr. Sales Persona!  You can also find Sheldon on his persona page in the research section of the Axure Sales project: <a href="https://lqcx8s.axshare.com/#g=1&p=personas&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Sheldon Sales Persona</a>.</p>

   <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">With our requirements gathered and our persona developed to give insight into the user&#39;s goals, needs and pain-points as they relate to our requirements, all that is left to do is visualize that information. Typically, I like to take all the information gathered to this point and read it in two completely different ways (in other words draw assumptions from two completely different points of view as I pretend to be Sheldon).  This results in a A/B test which will produce feedback that I can use to create a third design that meets &quot;Sheldon&#39;s&quot; expectations.   To facilitate this I create a A/B test plan where I lay out the different approaches I will take to each of the critical requirements for our design. You can find a copy of the A/B Test Plan at: <a href="https://lqcx8s.axshare.com/#g=1&p=a_b_test_plan&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">A/B Test Plan</a>.</p>

  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Craig)</h4>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">So why do we still need UX?  With so many design friendly tools out there in the world, including Wordpress, Countless Online Templates, Well Documented best practices, plus all of the successful user experiences which have already been developed that we can look at from companies such as Air BnB, Netflix and Amazon, why in the world does anyone ever need a UX Professional on their team anymore?  This question comes up a lot and I hear it frequently, especially when I first start working for a new company or client: Why can&#39;t I just take Amazon&#39;s approach and copy on my site?  It is successful for them, why shouldn&#39;t be successful for me?</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The truth is, you could, but it won&#39;t work.  It won&#39;t work because you are not Amazon.  Your site, no matter how similar it might be to Amazon does not serve the exact same purpose for the same user base as Amazon does and so it will never be as successful as you would wish it to be.  Jakob Neilson answered this same question at a recent UX Conference and I think his answer was spot on:</p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Exhibit A Detailed View Download - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">For part of this week Meg begain work on the detailed view of the Exhbit A Download.  This document will show the baselines and thresholds for each device type of each account for every carrier a customer has (yes, that is a lot of content).  The primary challenge (beyond just getting all the data on one document) is to differentiate the data readers will want to be scannable from the rest of the content. Meg presented four early mockups for the baseline section of the document to Matt this week where they settled on a general design direction to use going forward.</p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0"> OnePortal User Management - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Late last week we found out that some of our customers had to reach our to our Account Managers each time they created an employee in OnePortal in order to manage that new user&#39;s security group.  Additionally our employee management process did not take the advantage of an opportunity to inform our user&#39;s about the different secruity options available for new users.  As a result it was decided that we could greatly improve the experience through a redesign. </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Given that the Create New Employee process is one that isn't used on a regular basis I strove for Comprehension over Sped when determining the design direction for the new process.  This translated into creating a new workflow that breaks the process down into three steps, creating the employee, deciding if they should have access and what level of access followed by a review of all the decisions made.  This process makes it clear to the user the relationship between employees and OnePortal Users.  You can find the mockup for the User Management Process at: <a href="https://v6188b.axshare.com/#g=1&p=employee_page&fn=0" target="_blank">OnePortal User Management Mockup</a></p>

  </div>
  
  
   <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox"> A major part of this design was to make sure that users would be able to make an informed decision when determining a new OnePortal user&#39;s security group.  In order to faciliate this need I created a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/comparison-tables/" target="_blank">Feature Comparison Table</a> that shows the permissions each security group has.  Since we do not know how many security groups a given customer can have and feature tables only support 5-7 columns (otherwise it gets very hard to compare the information in the first column to that in the last column) I created a dynamic comparision table where the user is able to select which groups they want to appear in the table.  This allows them to only view the content they care about and put the ones they care about most side-by-side. </p>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Next week we will kickoff the first backend redesign microsite - Sales.  There will be a early Monday Morning Meeting to determine the scope for this new effort.</p>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This is another new feature that will be part of the OnePortal vMOX application.

  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Craig)</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">So who started this User Experience deal anyway? The actual concept of UX <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-user-experience/" target="_blank">can be traced back as far as the 1400&#39;s</a> with Leonardo Da Vinci&#39;s <a href="https://medium.com/@jguad89/early-lessons-in-ux-da-vincis-kitchen-nightmare-bf4c50e9a9ca" target="_blank"> &quot;Kitchen Nightmare&quot;</a>(hilarious story about an out of control conveyor belt driven kitchen complete with a fake fire alarm scare). However the first time the term User Experience actually came up as a job title was when a electrical engineer and cognitive scientist by the name of <a href="https://www.jnd.org/" target="_blank">Don Norman</a> joined Apple asked to be called a &quot;User Experience Architect&quot;. From this postion he eventually became the Vice President of the Advanced Technology Group where he lead Design effort which helped to bring about the successful launches of new Apple product design experiences.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Today Don Norman is one of the founders of the leading agency for Usability Research, Consulting and training, the Nielsen Norman Group. He is also the director of the Design Lab at the University of California, San Diego. So in summary Don Norman was basically the the first UX Professional - remind you of anyone else?</p>

  <hr class="vMOX tm-0"/>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-50 bm-10">Thoughts from the person behind the keyboard - Craig</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Lately there has been a decent amount of talk about Minimal Viable Product, from here on referred to as MVP, during the Amigos meetings.  I just wanted to take a second to address what Design is doing to make an MVP approach a reality for our team.  MVP and UX actually go way back, sharing a lot of history with <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021827.do" target="_blank">Lean UX</a> which focuses on iterative design that gets something, anything, in front of users as soon as possible in order to get feedback.  Feedback is the golden egg that drives everything in Lean UX and creating designs which get that all mighty, valuable and accurate feedback is as much an art as it is a science.  For our part, the design team has taken a look at our typical process with a fine-tooth comb to see if there is anywhere we can shorten our feedback loop.  Going forward we are going to through weekly ceremonies out the window in favor of on-demand feedback meetings and focus our initial designs on the specific needs of our primary persona in order to create the best and smallest MVP we can.     </p>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-70 bm-0">What Did Design Do This Week?</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Last week Meg completed the Employee Data Management mockup handoff with Matt, Tim &amp; Richard. During that meeting it was discovered that the current set of requirements would not create a Viable application for our users who use it to manage Data Discrepancies as it did not include anyway to view discrepancies once an action was taken to correct them.  As a result Meg was tasked with incorporating that functionality into the mockup with the addition of a history view.</p>
  
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">After taking some time to consider the impact on that mockup this new view would have an keeping in mind our renewed focus on MVP, Meg conceptualized several possibilities for a history view that is incorporated within the existing Employee Data Management Dashboard Design.  By taking this approach she was able to reduce the design from a five page design down to a three page design that creates a simpler mental model for our users and establishes a smaller development footprint for our development team. </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The first dashboard uses the top infographics to toggle the different content in the datatable located below them.  This reduces the interaction cost of each table and increases the discoverability of the workflow. You can view her first dashboard design at: <a href="https://86qnaq.axshare.com/#g=1&p=dashboard_v4&c=1" target="_blank">Dashboard Design 1</a></p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The second dashboard follows a similar approach, but it uses a graphic to increase the speed that users can translate the information on the page into action they need to take in order to keep their employee data up to date. You can view her second dashboard design at: <a href="https://86qnaq.axshare.com/#g=1&p=dashboard_v5&c=1" target="_blank">Dashboard Design 2</a></p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">Exhibit A Generation - Craig</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Last week I was able to get feedback on my initial A/B Design from Richard, Tim &amp; Michael R.  The primary feedback from that session was that we expect our Account Managers (the primary persona for this design) to want to experiment when creating their Exhibit A documents.  Secondly, Richard raised the point that these designs might be include more functionality than required for a MVP release.  With these two pieces of feedback I went back to the two designs I created the week before and attempted to create a single, more MVP design.</p>
  
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The result is a design that uses more common components to lower the development footprint, eliminates the Exhibit A Dashbaord view by tying the exhibit directly to the Opportunity and a design that puts all the interacts into a single menu within the workspace.  All of these design decisions should help create a more streamlined design that delivers just enough functionality to comfortably meet all of the needs of our Account Managers as they go through this process.   This design has not yet been reviewed by the stakeholders on this project.

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0"> Industry Analysis to Solution Generation - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">With Exhibit A Generation on hold for a bit this week I took the chance to pull the Industry Analysis out of on hold and create three new mockups based on the initial feedback I received from Matt.  Since this is a completely new feature that we have no precedent for in WEM, I decided to create three different approaches, which all meet the primary personas needs, but with different tones, messaging and depth.  You can see the high level layout of the test in the image below. </p>

   <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox"> Design A takes a fun, gamification approach to delivering minimal data at the start, but allows the user to dig in deeper to see in-depth information.   This approach might prove to not be serious enough, or it could lighten the mood and make this process more fun rather than confrontational.

  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Craig)</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Some of you might have heard myself or Meg mention the term &quot;<a href="http://microinteractions.com/what-is-a-microinteraction/" target="_blank">Microinteractions</a>&quot; in the past.  With the addition of Michael and the talent he has already shown at being able to implement them (without any direction from the design team by the way - <a href="../img/blog/july20/minions.gif" target="_blank">NICE!</a>), I thought it would be interesting to talk a bit about what Microinteractions are and why they have become &quot;All The Rage&quot;.  </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">A Microinteractions are a contained interactions that revolve around a single use case.  They are commonly found when you change a setting, complete a form, click a download, etc. and the truth is they are everywhere from the websites you visit to the appliances in your house and the radio in your car.  They are the bits of interaction that bring delight to the experience and invoke the feelings of completeness, trust and forethought in the end user.  The use of Microinteractions has increased greatly in the web as the capabilities of modern frameworks have recognized the importance of creating truly polished products.  </p>
    
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">So is it clear as mud what exactly they are? To be honest it took me a long time to get the hang of it, as there is a very fine line you have to walk with Microinteractions, as it is easy to get caught in the trap of &quot;too much of a good thing&quot;.

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Exhibit A Generation - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The majority of this week for me was spent working on the Exhibit A Generation project, conducting initial discovery, requirements documentation and creating the first A/B test mockups.  Going back to last week’s blog post, that means that right now this project is still in a Divergent Design state and is waiting on feedback from users and stakeholders to inform the design direction. Based on my research so far I was able to come up with two different ways that Account Managers might want to complete the task of creating Exhibit A’s based on how they work.  Design A takes a Workspace approach where the Account Manager does just a bit of initial configuration to then be presented with a workspace where they can rapidly make changes to the Exhibit Settings and see the effect of those changes on the page. Think of this as almost an Agile approach, where the Account Manager can experiment, receive quick feedback and use that feedback to make their next action. You can view the Design A Mockup at: <a href="https://hx0c50.axshare.com/#g=1&p=customer_prospectpage&fn=0" target="_blank">Exhibit A Mockup - Design A</a> </p>

  </div>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Design B takes more of a Waterfall approach.  In this design the user is walked through the entire process required to created a Exhibit A and is then presented with the result.  This design would allow those users who are very well informed quickly generate accurate Exhibit A documents, whereas Design A would better support users who would prefer to use experimentation to create their Exhibit A documents.

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Buttons Style Guide - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">I spent a decent part of today making a style guide page detailing the different sizes, colors and interactions we use for our buttons.  I broke the page down by each of the button sizes we have (Large, Medium, Small, Tiny) and the different states we have defined interactions for (Default, Hover, On Click and Disabled).  Hopefully you will all find this useful!  Meg and I will do our best to keep this updated should we add any additional button components in the future.

  <h4 class="vmox tm-50 bm-10">Thoughts from the person behind the keyboard - Craig</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Happy Four Day Work Week To Everyone! This was a short week, put there was still plenty going on in the UX/Design world at vMOX.  Lately I have been focused a lot on how we, as a design team can capture feedback (technical, requirements and usability) earlier in the design process.  In the past six months we have taken many steps (including this very blog you are reading) to try to improve the visibility to our designs while they are in process, but I think we can continue to improve.  If there is anything else that you can think of that you believe would help you stay in the loop as we are designing new features, please reach out to one of your friendly neighborhood designers at your earliest convenience.    </p>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-70 bm-0">What Did Design Do This Week?</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Meg has completed part of the Employee Data Management design and is preparing to hand the completed parts of that design over to Matt this afternoon. Matt &amp; Richard were able to gather feedback/conduct some research and come to decision on how users would like to solve Data Discrepancies within the OnePortal application.  This feedback has allowed Meg to create an improved Data Discrepancy Correction flow and finalize the Orphan Line resolution parts of the mockup.

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Industry Specific Solution Score By Device Type - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">For most of this week my time was spent gathering requirements and conducting initial discovery for the Industry Specific Solution Score By Device Type feature, which will be added to the WEM Solution Generator process.  This feature provide greater visibility into how each solution an Account Manager compares to the solutions being created by their peers who have clients with a similar portfolio.  I started my discovery process by looking into industry standards for displaying leaderboards, scorecards and performance metrics. I then related those standards to the information Matt laid out as requirements for the new Device Type Score to create several low fidelity mockups on the marker board.  Looking over the designs that I created during my rapid ideation session I thought they all fell on a spectrum were one end focused on the rank the Account Manager had achieved and the other end focused on the cost per line the Account Manager had achieved.  Using this insight I selected the two most drastic designs and fleshed them out with Axure in order to get feedback from Matt.  Based on Matt&quot;s insights and feedback I was able to create the first iteration scorecard shown on the far right in the image below. </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">There is still a lot of work left to go on this project, however for now we have shifted it to a On Hold status while we as a Design Team turn our focus to the Exhibit A project.

  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">Upcoming Efforts</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Continued Employee Data Work - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Meg will be continuing to work on the Employee Data part of the Action Center. She hopes to begin handing off parts of it to be developed late this week or early next week. </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Exhibit A Generation - Craig  </h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Starting Next week I will begin designing a process in WEM that will allow Account Mangers to generate Exhibit A documents.  This will help us provide additional visibility into how we bill our customers and hopefully reduce errors during the Exhibit A process during contract negotiations. </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Prospect Real Time Alerts Dashboard in OnePortal - Unassigned</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This is another new feature that will be part of the OnePortal vMOX application.  This will be a dashboard or collection of dashboard widgets which show the anticipated value we could bring to a customer through the different alerts that would be generated based on their mobile environment usage.  The intent is that we can use this view to show the value of our service with revealing our methods and means to the customer. . </p>
    
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Craig)</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Did you know there is actually a name for the UX process that Meg and I follow (and that there is <a href="../img/blog/July7/uxProcesses.png" target="_blank">more than one UX process</a> to begin with?)?  The process that we have had the most success with is known as the <a href="https://medium.com/seek-blog/design-thinking-101-the-double-diamond-approach-ii-4c0ce62f64c7" target="_blank">Double Diamond Approach</a>, which also sometimes referred to as the Divergent/Convergent Design Thinking Approach. The other day I ran across one of the best (if not possibly one of the most humorous) diagrams describing this process: </p>

    

  <div class="image-container bm-100">
    <h5 class="vmox center bm-10 tm-50">Double Diamond UX Process</h5>
    <img class="expand border" src="../img/blog/July7/DoubleDiamond.png" data-title="" data-caption=""/>
  </div>
  
  

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">So what makes this approach better than all the others?  In my opinion this approach is tailor made for one or two person UX teams as it forces the UX Design to shy away from becoming <a href="https://medium.com/@Michael.Peraza/dont-get-emotionally-attached-to-your-ideas-d9ff2af66b46" target="_blank">too attached to one particular solution</a> to a design challenge. In a nutshell this approach suggests that the best way to come up with creative and useful solutions is to first think of every possible way you can to solve the problem (divergent thinking).  This is often referred to as <a href="http://www.brandquarterly.com/conducting-rapid-ideation-workshop-10-questions-ask-get-started" target="_blank">Rapid Ideation</a> and is quickly followed up by a feedback session where the designer gets input from the product owner(s) on the multiple directions they have come up with.  An example of this is when we decided as a team to move to a ridged microsite navigation approach for the backend applications. </p>
  
   <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The hope is that by this point all of the stakeholders have reached a consensus on HOW we are going to the solve the challenge and we can start working on what that solution is going to look like.  This is where we get to start coming up with all sorts of crazy design approaches that will fit our solution approach and solve the challenge.  It is at this point were you see us put out a lot of A/B Designs that look wildly different from one another.  This is a common tactic that we use to help us converge again on the design which is going to best fit the solution we need to make an interface for.  Going back to the example of the navigation design you hopefully saw me putting out three different A/B tests in order to help me converge on the design direction that would best fit our user&#39;s needs.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Once it feels like we have converged on a design direction we begin iterating on that direction until the design gets the sign off from all the stakeholders (hint that is you, and yes, I mean all of you).  This is the point of the process when you will see us create multiple folders in the Axure file each named &quot;Iteration X&quot;.  The goal of all of these iterations is to finalize the details of the design in order to get it ready for handoff. Going back to our example of the navigation redesign, this is when you will see the navigation shift from white to black based on the feedback from leadership. </p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Over the last two weeks Meg has been diving into the Employee Data Management side of the OnePortal Action Center Effort.  This past week saw Meg demo her second iteration design to the Four Amigos, who affirmed the design is heading down the correct path.  Discussion around the mockup brought to light several conceptual questions around Data Discrepancy Resolution which Matt is going to interview our users about in order to gather insight into.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The primary question we are looking to find an answer to is how users will solve Data Discrepancy issues: Batch or One-by-One and when they do resolve a discrepancy, how much data in the employee record to they expect will be updated?

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX Backend Navigation 2.0 - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Based on the results of the A/B testing completed in the last couple of weeks I was able to finalize and handoff the updated vMOX WEM Navigation Scheme.  This approach will allow us to create customized view to each of the different job roles within the vMOX company that the user will be presented with after login.  This means each role will eventually have a set of links, dashboard widgets, etc which drive action within the specific responsibilities for their role.  If the user needs to switch to a different role they can interact with the global menu (located top left), which is also the future location of the their favorites links.

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communication Management - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I was able to complete the Release Two mockup for the Communications Management part of the OnePortal Action Center Effort.  This release saw several enhancements added to the MVP release including a History view, Sent Reports Confirmation Page, Approval/Rejected Feedback, Donut Charts, Review Page and a reconceptualized Dashboard View that helps the user establish a more accurate <a href=” https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/” target=”_blank>mental model</a> of the communications monthly cycle.  The hope is that this new view will help the user be able to quickly scan and digest the information on the dashboard and synthesize that information down into actions they need to take in order to send the reports out that will keep their users informed (and hopefully saving money).  The history view, review step and additional feedback in the approval view all help complete the feedback loop between the users action and the action taken by the OnePortal system.  Hopefully this will make our users more comfortable as they prepare to send out communications to possibly hundreds or thousands of their employees.

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Did you know that UX itself is not a role? Just like &quot;Development &quot; isn’t a role, but rather a type of position, UX can refer to a <a href="https://uxmastery.com/ux-roles-within-ux/" target="_blank">wide collection</a> of different positions, each with their own specific meanings. The most common of these roles are:</p>

    <ul>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">So what role do Meg and I fill here at vMOX?  I l would love to think that we are examples of the elusive UX Unicorn (Yes, yes that is actually an industry standard UX Title). Think I am kidding? Just <a href="../img/blog/june29/unicorn.png" target="_blank">Google it (trust me - its worth clicking on this)</a>. However I don&#39;t think we can quite claim that level of talent.  For now, lets just stick with UX Designer as documented by a stereotypical British accent wildlife biologist below:</p>

  <hr class="vMOX tm-0"/>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">What Did Design Do This Week?</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week Meg started designing the next phase of the Action Center Effort, the Employee Data Import and Data Reconciliation Process.  Taking an MVP/Iterative Design approach her first mockup will show how users will be able to reconcilie differences between the three sources of truth using a multiple set workflow.  She has just begun to create an Axure mockup for this process and hopes to have it complete for the next development sprint.</p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX Backend Navigation 2.0 - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Based on the results of the <a href="https://obyzb2.axshare.com/#g=1" target="_blank">vMOX Navigation Card Sort Study</a> we determined that most of our users would organize the navigation options based by role.  This suggested that users would relate to a microsite layout where the user is directed to a role-based experience upon log in. </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I began the design process by creating two A/B tests which were sent out company wide.  The first A/B Test tested two designs which were purposefully design be polar opposites of one another.  The first design focused on making as much of the navigation visible as possible, while the second tried to hide away as much as possible.  The results of that test suggested users preferred a cleaner look, but did not want to completely hide away all of the navigation.  This led to a second A/B test were one design showed all of the navigation options in a flyout menu, while the second displayed them in a contextual navigation bar.  </p>

  </div>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The results of the second A/B test showed that users overwhelmingly preferred to have the navigation bar.  Therefore, the second design was used to create a finalized version which has an improved look-in-feel over the version used in the A/B test.  The finalized version also has a responsive view, which will adapt down to a phone with a viewport of 380px wide.

  <h4 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">What Did Design Do This Week?</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Advantage Card Sort Results - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week Meg took the Card Sort Results for Advantage as far as she could based on our current knowledge of the requirements for the navigation.  It is our understanding that there will most likely be many changes to the links which will be presented within the structure by the time we will need to hand off the design.  If you would like to view Meg's analysis of the results you can find a color coded Excel File at: <a href="../img/blog/june8/AdvantageCardSortResults.csv.xlsx" target="_blank">Advantage Card Sort Results.</a></p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Project Kiwi Look &amp; Feel - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week marked the beginning of the next step in the ongoing effort to define what the Kiwi solution will look like for our internal team.  Our hope is create a solution that will improve the flow of knowledge from Design to Development and to QA.  Meg and I have both spent a fair amount of time considering where we meet challenges in this process (you can even <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=personas_internal" target="_blank">view the personas</a> we made) and hope that we can use Kiwi to help us create a clear, consistent design direction which can be applied to both vMOX and Advantage. We are still working out the details of what exactly what functionality we will need to accomplish that, but this week Meg was able to make large strides in define what that solution will look &amp; feel like. </p>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Thank you to all of you who have seen the A/B Test Meg released and who gave your feedback on for the navigation system for Kiwi.  Ever wonder how designers come up with the color schemes that they end up using?  Meg developed the color scheme for Kiwi using a process known as an Inspiration Board which she paired with a simple set of Design Direction Principles she developed for Kiwi.  You can see both in her Axure Mockup at: <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=color_research&c=1" target="_blank">Kiwi Inspiration Board Mockup</a>.  The Design Direction Principles that she developed describe not only the impression that we want the entire application to give users, but also the impression the colors we use to give.  For example some the principles Meg decided on for Kiwi were Simple, Relatable, To the point, Relatable and Hub.  These descriptive words suggest colors that are calming, rich and closer to the blue-green spectrum, which is why you see Meg gravitate to a dark color scheme with a strong green accent color. Meg then paired that with Accessibility guidelines to develop the color scheme you interacted with in the A/B test. If anyone else would like to give their feedback on the A/B test you can view the mockup at: <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=navigation_option_1&c=1" target="_blank">Kiwi A/B Test Mockup Option 1</a> and <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=navigation_option_2&c=1" target="_blank">Kiwi A/B Test Mockup Option 2</a>.</p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Data Table &amp; Form View Kiwi Pages - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week was focused on documenting two very common views we have in all of our applications: Forms and Data Tables.  Given the frequency that we encounter them I thought it would be a logical place to begin creating a deep dive Kiwi page that sets the design and interaction standards for a common design component.  The style guide for the Data Table and the one for the Form do their best to not only describe the atomic components of the design and how to style them, but also to explain some of the design theory behind why I designed the page the way I did.  My hope is that these style guide pages can be referenced as the source of truth for how we should display, interact with and style Data Tables and Forms across all of our applications going forward. If you get the chance I would greatly appreciate any feedback you have on these example style guides so that I better tailor the development of new pages in the future.  If you are interested in checking them out, you can view the Data Tables Style Guide page at: <a href="https://grahamcr.github.io/kiwi/StyleGuide/List.html" target="_blank">vMOX Data Tables Page</a> and the Forms Style Guide Page at: <a href="https://grahamcr.github.io/kiwi/StyleGuide/Form.html" target="_blank">vMOX Forms Page</a>. </p>

   <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communications Management, A MVP Story - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I completed the second iteration of the Communications Management Mockup for the OnePortal Action Center Effort.  During the Design Review Meeting with Matt, Tim &amp; Richard today it was decided that this part of the effort would be a great candidate for trying out a MVP approach.  As a result of this decision the product team was able to narrow down the scope of this feature from a nearly 20-page mockup to a 2-page mockup. This is a great opportunity to see if focusing on smaller design/development tasks can help us achieve high quality results, better/faster alignment on direction and faster feedback loops which can help direct future efforts to focus in on user needs.  The idea here is that if we can develop and release smaller bits of complete functionality and get feedback on it we can utilize that feedback to guide the decisions we make regarding what gets designed and developed next.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The MVP version of the Communications Management mockup will allow the user to see the status of each of their reports, view an example of a report and approve/deny that report for release.

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox"> </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">UX is a pretty new type of job, but you can actually go back a very long ways to find its roots.  UX was officially coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman" target="_blank">Donald Norman</a> in 1993, however you can find examples of UX further back from notable advancements made by <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-history-of-ux-design-20592208a336" target="_blank">Walt Disney, Henry Ford, Toyota &amp; Da Vinci</a></p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">UX design even finds it's way into the most unexpected places, even comedy shows. The video below is a bit by Demetri Martin about Bathroom Technology. In the joke he talks about how modern bathroom fixtures &quot;are solutions for problems that never existed&quot;. While you are listening try to count how many UX prinicples he complains about the bathroom fixures violating.</p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communications Management - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I completed the first iteration of the Communications Management onboarding and approval process mockup.  This functionality will allow our customers to self-enroll in the various reports we offer and provide valuable visibility into their devices, usage and cost. On Friday I met with the Amigos and discussed the mockup in detail.  Several impactful decisions were made which will result in the need to go back and create a second iteration of the management mockup.  The primary changes to be made are the custom email page.  In the first iteration we had only two choices and required a waiting period, the second iteration has three options and no waiting period.  You can find the first iteration mockup of that page at&#58; <a href="https://ony9kb.axshare.com/#p=custom_email_switch_page_1&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Custom Email Page, Iteration One</a> and the second iteration of the page at&#58; <a href="https://ony9kb.axshare.com/#g=2&p=custom_email_switch_page&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Custom Email Page, Iteration Two</a>.

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX and Advantage backend redesign - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Thanks again to everyone who participated in the card sort activity!  Craig presented the vMOX findings this week and it helped to drive important decisions about the navigation scheme.  It took longer to get data on the Advantage side so I just started to analyze the results but so far they are consistent with vMOX. Here again are the vMOX results: <a target="_blank" href="https://obyzb2.axshare.com/#g=1&p=high_level_takeaways">vMOX Card Sort Study Results</a>.  Craig and I met with the Amigos to discuss the results and several decisions we made.  Based the results it was concluded that goal of our redesign is to eventually break out the navigation structure into different microsites that all wrap up to a parent navigation bar.  In other words, if you work for sales you would log in and find that you are redirected to vmox-portal.com/sales and are presented with a navigation structure which only includes links relevant to your job responsibilities.  If you, as a sales person, need to see something from operations you would go up one level to the parent and then navigate back down to the Procurement microsite. </p>
  
  
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">Upcoming Efforts</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communications Management - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Next week I will be continuing to make changes to the Communications mockup based on the feedback from the meeting Friday.  Once those changes are complete I will bring the design back to the Amigos for approval and then start developing Kiwi pages for the content to prepare the design for handoff. </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">A effort that will probably not start next week, but is coming soon is the Employee Data Upload in OnePortal. Matt is busy getting the requirements together to hand off for next design sprint.  </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX and Advantage backend redesign - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Craig and I are going to redesign the menu based on the decisions made about navigation.  Then he will update the mockup of the vMOX menu.  I am going to finish analyzing the Advantage card sort results and create a mockup of that menu.  The menu is the first step in a complete backend redesign for both companies. </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Project Kiwi - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">I am working primarily on two things with Kiwi.  The first is developing pages so that the content is accessible, even if the look and feel is not yet where I want it.  Next week I plan to create the text page which includes information on fonts, headings, etc.  I am also still working on the Axure mockup to finalize the design. </p>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Meg)</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Since I have color on the brain this week, here are interesting UX facts about color.  Did you know that Google once tested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01marissa.html?pagewanted=3" target="_blank">41 shades of blue</a> for their links to find out which color people were most likely to click on?  You can read more about how to use color when designing here: <a target="_blank" href="https://uxplanet.org/color-theory-brief-guide-for-designers-76e11c57eaa">Intro to Color Theory</a> and here: <a target="_blank" href=""> Tips for choosing colors</a>. </p>

<p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Also, did you know that Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind?  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/20/the-face-of-facebook">He chose blue</a> for Facebook's primary color because it is the color that he can see best.  <a href="https://nei.nih.gov/health/color_blindness/facts_about" target="_blank">8% of men are red-green color blind</a> and it is an <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-easiest-part-about-designing-accessible-websites-76cd6b9a7ae4" target="_blank">important factor to consider when designing</a>. You can simulate different kinds of color blindness using <a href="http://colororacle.org/index.html" target="_blank">ColorOracle</a>; color contrast checkers can also be very helpful.
