  <hr class="vMOX tm-0"/>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-50 bm-10">Thoughts from the person behind the keyboard - Craig</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Lately there has been a decent amount of talk about Minimal Viable Product, from here on referred to as MVP, during the Amigos meetings.  I just wanted to take a second to address what Design is doing to make an MVP approach a reality for our team.  MVP and UX actually go way back, sharing a lot of history with <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021827.do" target="_blank">Lean UX</a> which focuses on iterative design that gets something, anything, in front of users as soon as possible in order to get feedback.  Feedback is the golden egg that drives everything in Lean UX and creating designs which get that all mighty, valuable and accurate feedback is as much an art as it is a science.  For our part, the design team has taken a look at our typical process with a fine-tooth comb to see if there is anywhere we can shorten our feedback loop.  Going forward we are going to through weekly ceremonies out the window in favor of on-demand feedback meetings and focus our initial designs on the specific needs of our primary persona in order to create the best and smallest MVP we can.     </p>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-70 bm-0">What Did Design Do This Week?</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Last week Meg completed the Employee Data Management mockup handoff with Matt, Tim &amp; Richard. During that meeting it was discovered that the current set of requirements would not create a Viable application for our users who use it to manage Data Discrepancies as it did not include anyway to view discrepancies once an action was taken to correct them.  As a result Meg was tasked with incorporating that functionality into the mockup with the addition of a history view.</p>
  
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">After taking some time to consider the impact on that mockup this new view would have an keeping in mind our renewed focus on MVP, Meg conceptualized several possibilities for a history view that is incorporated within the existing Employee Data Management Dashboard Design.  By taking this approach she was able to reduce the design from a five page design down to a three page design that creates a simpler mental model for our users and establishes a smaller development footprint for our development team. </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The first dashboard uses the top infographics to toggle the different content in the datatable located below them.  This reduces the interaction cost of each table and increases the discoverability of the workflow. You can view her first dashboard design at: <a href="https://86qnaq.axshare.com/#g=1&p=dashboard_v4&c=1" target="_blank">Dashboard Design 1</a></p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The second dashboard follows a similar approach, but it uses a graphic to increase the speed that users can translate the information on the page into action they need to take in order to keep their employee data up to date. You can view her second dashboard design at: <a href="https://86qnaq.axshare.com/#g=1&p=dashboard_v5&c=1" target="_blank">Dashboard Design 2</a></p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">Exhibit A Generation - Craig</h5>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Last week I was able to get feedback on my initial A/B Design from Richard, Tim &amp; Michael R.  The primary feedback from that session was that we expect our Account Managers (the primary persona for this design) to want to experiment when creating their Exhibit A documents.  Secondly, Richard raised the point that these designs might be include more functionality than required for a MVP release.  With these two pieces of feedback I went back to the two designs I created the week before and attempted to create a single, more MVP design.</p>
  
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The result is a design that uses more common components to lower the development footprint, eliminates the Exhibit A Dashbaord view by tying the exhibit directly to the Opportunity and a design that puts all the interacts into a single menu within the workspace.  All of these design decisions should help create a more streamlined design that delivers just enough functionality to comfortably meet all of the needs of our Account Managers as they go through this process.   This design has not yet been reviewed by the stakeholders on this project.

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0"> Industry Analysis to Solution Generation - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">With Exhibit A Generation on hold for a bit this week I took the chance to pull the Industry Analysis out of on hold and create three new mockups based on the initial feedback I received from Matt.  Since this is a completely new feature that we have no precedent for in WEM, I decided to create three different approaches, which all meet the primary personas needs, but with different tones, messaging and depth.  You can see the high level layout of the test in the image below. </p>

  </div>
  
  
   <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox"> Design A takes a fun, gamification approach to delivering minimal data at the start, but allows the user to dig in deeper to see in-depth information.   This approach might prove to not be serious enough, or it could lighten the mood and make this process more fun rather than confrontational.

   <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Design B is our luxury, full-fledged solution.  The wealth of data can go a long way to explaining why the users solution is ranked the way it is.

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Prospect Real Time Alerts Dashboard in OnePortal - Unassigned</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This is another new feature that will be part of the OnePortal vMOX application.  This will be a dashboard or collection of dashboard widgets which show the anticipated value we could bring to a customer through the different alerts that would be generated based on their mobile environment usage.  The intent is that we can use this view to show the value of our service with revealing our methods and means to the customer.</p>
    
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Craig)</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Some of you might have heard myself or Meg mention the term &quot;<a href="http://microinteractions.com/what-is-a-microinteraction/" target="_blank">Microinteractions</a>&quot; in the past.  With the addition of Michael and the talent he has already shown at being able to implement them (without any direction from the design team by the way - <a href="../img/blog/july20/minions.gif" target="_blank">NICE!</a>), I thought it would be interesting to talk a bit about what Microinteractions are and why they have become &quot;All The Rage&quot;.  </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">A Microinteractions are a contained interactions that revolve around a single use case.  They are commonly found when you change a setting, complete a form, click a download, etc. and the truth is they are everywhere from the websites you visit to the appliances in your house and the radio in your car.  They are the bits of interaction that bring delight to the experience and invoke the feelings of completeness, trust and forethought in the end user.  The use of Microinteractions has increased greatly in the web as the capabilities of modern frameworks have recognized the importance of creating truly polished products.  </p>
    
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">So is it clear as mud what exactly they are? To be honest it took me a long time to get the hang of it, as there is a very fine line you have to walk with Microinteractions, as it is easy to get caught in the trap of &quot;too much of a good thing&quot;.  Below are some examples of well done Microinteractions: </p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Exhibit A Generation - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The majority of this week for me was spent working on the Exhibit A Generation project, conducting initial discovery, requirements documentation and creating the first A/B test mockups.  Going back to last week’s blog post, that means that right now this project is still in a Divergent Design state and is waiting on feedback from users and stakeholders to inform the design direction. Based on my research so far I was able to come up with two different ways that Account Managers might want to complete the task of creating Exhibit A’s based on how they work.  Design A takes a Workspace approach where the Account Manager does just a bit of initial configuration to then be presented with a workspace where they can rapidly make changes to the Exhibit Settings and see the effect of those changes on the page. Think of this as almost an Agile approach, where the Account Manager can experiment, receive quick feedback and use that feedback to make their next action. You can view the Design A Mockup at: <a href="https://hx0c50.axshare.com/#g=1&p=customer_prospectpage&fn=0" target="_blank">Exhibit A Mockup - Design A</a> </p>

  </div>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Design B takes more of a Waterfall approach.  In this design the user is walked through the entire process required to created a Exhibit A and is then presented with the result.  This design would allow those users who are very well informed quickly generate accurate Exhibit A documents, whereas Design A would better support users who would prefer to use experimentation to create their Exhibit A documents.

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">I spent a decent part of today making a style guide page detailing the different sizes, colors and interactions we use for our buttons.  I broke the page down by each of the button sizes we have (Large, Medium, Small, Tiny) and the different states we have defined interactions for (Default, Hover, On Click and Disabled).  Hopefully you will all find this useful!  Meg and I will do our best to keep this updated should we add any additional button components in the future.

  <h4 class="vmox tm-50 bm-10">Thoughts from the person behind the keyboard - Craig</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Happy Four Day Work Week To Everyone! This was a short week, put there was still plenty going on in the UX/Design world at vMOX.  Lately I have been focused a lot on how we, as a design team can capture feedback (technical, requirements and usability) earlier in the design process.  In the past six months we have taken many steps (including this very blog you are reading) to try to improve the visibility to our designs while they are in process, but I think we can continue to improve.  If there is anything else that you can think of that you believe would help you stay in the loop as we are designing new features, please reach out to one of your friendly neighborhood designers at your earliest convenience.    </p>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-70 bm-0">What Did Design Do This Week?</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Meg has completed part of the Employee Data Management design and is preparing to hand the completed parts of that design over to Matt this afternoon. Matt &amp; Richard were able to gather feedback/conduct some research and come to decision on how users would like to solve Data Discrepancies within the OnePortal application.  This feedback has allowed Meg to create an improved Data Discrepancy Correction flow and finalize the Orphan Line resolution parts of the mockup.  If you would like to view the in-progress mockup you can find it at: <a href="https://mxt82q.axshare.com/#g=1&p=dashboard" target="_blank">Employee Data Management Mockup</a>.</p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Industry Specific Solution Score By Device Type - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">For most of this week my time was spent gathering requirements and conducting initial discovery for the Industry Specific Solution Score By Device Type feature, which will be added to the WEM Solution Generator process.  This feature provide greater visibility into how each solution an Account Manager compares to the solutions being created by their peers who have clients with a similar portfolio.  I started my discovery process by looking into industry standards for displaying leaderboards, scorecards and performance metrics. I then related those standards to the information Matt laid out as requirements for the new Device Type Score to create several low fidelity mockups on the marker board.  Looking over the designs that I created during my rapid ideation session I thought they all fell on a spectrum were one end focused on the rank the Account Manager had achieved and the other end focused on the cost per line the Account Manager had achieved.  Using this insight I selected the two most drastic designs and fleshed them out with Axure in order to get feedback from Matt.  Based on Matt&quot;s insights and feedback I was able to create the first iteration scorecard shown on the far right in the image below. </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">There is still a lot of work left to go on this project, however for now we have shifted it to a On Hold status while we as a Design Team turn our focus to the Exhibit A project.

  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">Upcoming Efforts</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Continued Employee Data Work - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Meg will be continuing to work on the Employee Data part of the Action Center. She hopes to begin handing off parts of it to be developed late this week or early next week. </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Exhibit A Generation - Craig  </h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Starting Next week I will begin designing a process in WEM that will allow Account Mangers to generate Exhibit A documents.  This will help us provide additional visibility into how we bill our customers and hopefully reduce errors during the Exhibit A process during contract negotiations. </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Prospect Real Time Alerts Dashboard in OnePortal - Unassigned</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This is another new feature that will be part of the OnePortal vMOX application.  This will be a dashboard or collection of dashboard widgets which show the anticipated value we could bring to a customer through the different alerts that would be generated based on their mobile environment usage.  The intent is that we can use this view to show the value of our service with revealing our methods and means to the customer. . </p>
    
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Craig)</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Did you know there is actually a name for the UX process that Meg and I follow (and that there is <a href="../img/blog/July7/uxProcesses.png" target="_blank">more than one UX process</a> to begin with?)?  The process that we have had the most success with is known as the <a href="https://medium.com/seek-blog/design-thinking-101-the-double-diamond-approach-ii-4c0ce62f64c7" target="_blank">Double Diamond Approach</a>, which also sometimes referred to as the Divergent/Convergent Design Thinking Approach. The other day I ran across one of the best (if not possibly one of the most humorous) diagrams describing this process: </p>

    

  <div class="image-container bm-100">
    <h5 class="vmox center bm-10 tm-50">Double Diamond UX Process</h5>
    <img class="expand border" src="../img/blog/July7/DoubleDiamond.png" data-title="" data-caption=""/>
  </div>
  
  

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">So what makes this approach better than all the others?  In my opinion this approach is tailor made for one or two person UX teams as it forces the UX Design to shy away from becoming <a href="https://medium.com/@Michael.Peraza/dont-get-emotionally-attached-to-your-ideas-d9ff2af66b46" target="_blank">too attached to one particular solution</a> to a design challenge. In a nutshell this approach suggests that the best way to come up with creative and useful solutions is to first think of every possible way you can to solve the problem (divergent thinking).  This is often referred to as <a href="http://www.brandquarterly.com/conducting-rapid-ideation-workshop-10-questions-ask-get-started" target="_blank">Rapid Ideation</a> and is quickly followed up by a feedback session where the designer gets input from the product owner(s) on the multiple directions they have come up with.  An example of this is when we decided as a team to move to a ridged microsite navigation approach for the backend applications. </p>
  
   <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The hope is that by this point all of the stakeholders have reached a consensus on HOW we are going to the solve the challenge and we can start working on what that solution is going to look like.  This is where we get to start coming up with all sorts of crazy design approaches that will fit our solution approach and solve the challenge.  It is at this point were you see us put out a lot of A/B Designs that look wildly different from one another.  This is a common tactic that we use to help us converge again on the design which is going to best fit the solution we need to make an interface for.  Going back to the example of the navigation design you hopefully saw me putting out three different A/B tests in order to help me converge on the design direction that would best fit our user&#39;s needs.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Once it feels like we have converged on a design direction we begin iterating on that direction until the design gets the sign off from all the stakeholders (hint that is you, and yes, I mean all of you).  This is the point of the process when you will see us create multiple folders in the Axure file each named &quot;Iteration X&quot;.  The goal of all of these iterations is to finalize the details of the design in order to get it ready for handoff. Going back to our example of the navigation redesign, this is when you will see the navigation shift from white to black based on the feedback from leadership. </p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Over the last two weeks Meg has been diving into the Employee Data Management side of the OnePortal Action Center Effort.  This past week saw Meg demo her second iteration design to the Four Amigos, who affirmed the design is heading down the correct path.  Discussion around the mockup brought to light several conceptual questions around Data Discrepancy Resolution which Matt is going to interview our users about in order to gather insight into.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The primary question we are looking to find an answer to is how users will solve Data Discrepancy issues: Batch or One-by-One and when they do resolve a discrepancy, how much data in the employee record to they expect will be updated?

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX Backend Navigation 2.0 - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Based on the results of the A/B testing completed in the last couple of weeks I was able to finalize and handoff the updated vMOX WEM Navigation Scheme.  This approach will allow us to create customized view to each of the different job roles within the vMOX company that the user will be presented with after login.  This means each role will eventually have a set of links, dashboard widgets, etc which drive action within the specific responsibilities for their role.  If the user needs to switch to a different role they can interact with the global menu (located top left), which is also the future location of the their favorites links.

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communication Management - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I was able to complete the Release Two mockup for the Communications Management part of the OnePortal Action Center Effort.  This release saw several enhancements added to the MVP release including a History view, Sent Reports Confirmation Page, Approval/Rejected Feedback, Donut Charts, Review Page and a reconceptualized Dashboard View that helps the user establish a more accurate <a href=” https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/” target=”_blank>mental model</a> of the communications monthly cycle.  The hope is that this new view will help the user be able to quickly scan and digest the information on the dashboard and synthesize that information down into actions they need to take in order to send the reports out that will keep their users informed (and hopefully saving money).  The history view, review step and additional feedback in the approval view all help complete the feedback loop between the users action and the action taken by the OnePortal system.  Hopefully this will make our users more comfortable as they prepare to send out communications to possibly hundreds or thousands of their employees.

This rank is meant to serve as a tool that the Account Managers can use to see how their solutions stack up for a given deviece type within the industry their customer falls in compared to the solutions being generated by their coworkers.

  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Craig)</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Did you know that UX itself is not a role? Just like &quot;Development &quot; isn’t a role, but rather a type of position, UX can refer to a <a href="https://uxmastery.com/ux-roles-within-ux/" target="_blank">wide collection</a> of different positions, each with their own specific meanings. The most common of these roles are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">UX Researcher</span>: focus on unpacking challenges through the use of studies, interviews and analysis.  Their work generally results in the creation of <a href="http://modernux.se/docs/userstorymapping/" target="_blank">StoryMaps</a>, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persona/" target="_blank">Personas</a>, <a href="https://uxmastery.com/how-to-create-a-customer-journey-map/" target="_blank">Journey Maps</a> and more</li>
      
      <li><span class="bold">Information Architects</span>: focus on how to organize content within a site and how the overall experience should flow.  Their work generally results in the creation of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-prototype-hi-lo-fidelity/" target="_blank">Low Fidelity Mockups</a>, Flow Diagrams and more</li>
      
      <li><span class="bold">Interaction Designer</span>: focus on tasks such as what screens should go where in an applications, how different actions within a screen will effect the content, and transitions between screens.  Their work generally results in the creation of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-prototype-hi-lo-fidelity/" target="_blank">High Fedility Mockups</a></li>
        
      <li><span class="bold">Visual Designer</span>: focus on typography, layout, color, graphics and texture.  Their work generally results in the creation of Icon Packs, Style Guides and High Fidelity Mockups</li>
  </ul>


  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">So what role do Meg and I fill here at vMOX?  I l would love to think that we are examples of the elusive UX Unicorn (Yes, yes that is actually an industry standard UX Title). Think I am kidding? Just <a href="../img/blog/june29/unicorn.png" target="_blank">Google it (trust me - its worth clicking on this)</a>. However I don&#39;t think we can quite claim that level of talent.  For now, lets just stick with UX Designer as documented by a stereotypical British accent wildlife biologist below:</p>

  <h4 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">What Did Design Do This Week?</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week Meg started designing the next phase of the Action Center Effort, the Employee Data Import and Data Reconciliation Process.  Taking an MVP/Iterative Design approach her first mockup will show how users will be able to reconcilie differences between the three sources of truth using a multiple set workflow.  She has just begun to create an Axure mockup for this process and hopes to have it complete for the next development sprint.</p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX Backend Navigation 2.0 - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Based on the results of the <a href="https://obyzb2.axshare.com/#g=1" target="_blank">vMOX Navigation Card Sort Study</a> we determined that most of our users would organize the navigation options based by role.  This suggested that users would relate to a microsite layout where the user is directed to a role-based experience upon log in. </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I began the design process by creating two A/B tests which were sent out company wide.  The first A/B Test tested two designs which were purposefully design be polar opposites of one another.  The first design focused on making as much of the navigation visible as possible, while the second tried to hide away as much as possible.  The results of that test suggested users preferred a cleaner look, but did not want to completely hide away all of the navigation.  This led to a second A/B test were one design showed all of the navigation options in a flyout menu, while the second displayed them in a contextual navigation bar.  </p>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The results of the second A/B test showed that users overwhelmingly preferred to have the navigation bar.  Therefore, the second design was used to create a finalized version which has an improved look-in-feel over the version used in the A/B test.  The finalized version also has a responsive view, which will adapt down to a phone with a viewport of 380px wide.

  <h4 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">What Did Design Do This Week?</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Advantage Card Sort Results - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week Meg took the Card Sort Results for Advantage as far as she could based on our current knowledge of the requirements for the navigation.  It is our understanding that there will most likely be many changes to the links which will be presented within the structure by the time we will need to hand off the design.  If you would like to view Meg's analysis of the results you can find a color coded Excel File at: <a href="../img/blog/june8/AdvantageCardSortResults.csv.xlsx" target="_blank">Advantage Card Sort Results.</a></p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Project Kiwi Look &amp; Feel - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week marked the beginning of the next step in the ongoing effort to define what the Kiwi solution will look like for our internal team.  Our hope is create a solution that will improve the flow of knowledge from Design to Development and to QA.  Meg and I have both spent a fair amount of time considering where we meet challenges in this process (you can even <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=personas_internal" target="_blank">view the personas</a> we made) and hope that we can use Kiwi to help us create a clear, consistent design direction which can be applied to both vMOX and Advantage. We are still working out the details of what exactly what functionality we will need to accomplish that, but this week Meg was able to make large strides in define what that solution will look &amp; feel like. </p>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Thank you to all of you who have seen the A/B Test Meg released and who gave your feedback on for the navigation system for Kiwi.  Ever wonder how designers come up with the color schemes that they end up using?  Meg developed the color scheme for Kiwi using a process known as an Inspiration Board which she paired with a simple set of Design Direction Principles she developed for Kiwi.  You can see both in her Axure Mockup at: <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=color_research&c=1" target="_blank">Kiwi Inspiration Board Mockup</a>.  The Design Direction Principles that she developed describe not only the impression that we want the entire application to give users, but also the impression the colors we use to give.  For example some the principles Meg decided on for Kiwi were Simple, Relatable, To the point, Relatable and Hub.  These descriptive words suggest colors that are calming, rich and closer to the blue-green spectrum, which is why you see Meg gravitate to a dark color scheme with a strong green accent color. Meg then paired that with Accessibility guidelines to develop the color scheme you interacted with in the A/B test. If anyone else would like to give their feedback on the A/B test you can view the mockup at: <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=navigation_option_1&c=1" target="_blank">Kiwi A/B Test Mockup Option 1</a> and <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=navigation_option_2&c=1" target="_blank">Kiwi A/B Test Mockup Option 2</a>.</p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Data Table &amp; Form View Kiwi Pages - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week was focused on documenting two very common views we have in all of our applications: Forms and Data Tables.  Given the frequency that we encounter them I thought it would be a logical place to begin creating a deep dive Kiwi page that sets the design and interaction standards for a common design component.  The style guide for the Data Table and the one for the Form do their best to not only describe the atomic components of the design and how to style them, but also to explain some of the design theory behind why I designed the page the way I did.  My hope is that these style guide pages can be referenced as the source of truth for how we should display, interact with and style Data Tables and Forms across all of our applications going forward. If you get the chance I would greatly appreciate any feedback you have on these example style guides so that I better tailor the development of new pages in the future.  If you are interested in checking them out, you can view the Data Tables Style Guide page at: <a href="https://grahamcr.github.io/kiwi/StyleGuide/List.html" target="_blank">vMOX Data Tables Page</a> and the Forms Style Guide Page at: <a href="https://grahamcr.github.io/kiwi/StyleGuide/Form.html" target="_blank">vMOX Forms Page</a>. </p>

   <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communications Management, A MVP Story - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I completed the second iteration of the Communications Management Mockup for the OnePortal Action Center Effort.  During the Design Review Meeting with Matt, Tim &amp; Richard today it was decided that this part of the effort would be a great candidate for trying out a MVP approach.  As a result of this decision the product team was able to narrow down the scope of this feature from a nearly 20-page mockup to a 2-page mockup. This is a great opportunity to see if focusing on smaller design/development tasks can help us achieve high quality results, better/faster alignment on direction and faster feedback loops which can help direct future efforts to focus in on user needs.  The idea here is that if we can develop and release smaller bits of complete functionality and get feedback on it we can utilize that feedback to guide the decisions we make regarding what gets designed and developed next.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The MVP version of the Communications Management mockup will allow the user to see the status of each of their reports, view an example of a report and approve/deny that report for release.  You can view a mockup of the new Communications Management MVP at: <a href="https://ony9kb.axshare.com/#p=enroll_in_reports_-_start&fn=0&g=1&c=1" target="_blank">Communications Management MVP Mockup.</a></p>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox"> </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">UX is a pretty new type of job, but you can actually go back a very long ways to find its roots.  UX was officially coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman" target="_blank">Donald Norman</a> in 1993, however you can find examples of UX further back from notable advancements made by <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-history-of-ux-design-20592208a336" target="_blank">Walt Disney, Henry Ford, Toyota &amp; Da Vinci</a></p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">UX design even finds it's way into the most unexpected places, even comedy shows. The video below is a bit by Demetri Martin about Bathroom Technology. In the joke he talks about how modern bathroom fixtures &quot;are solutions for problems that never existed&quot;. While you are listening try to count how many UX prinicples he complains about the bathroom fixures violating.</p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communications Management - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I completed the first iteration of the Communications Management onboarding and approval process mockup.  This functionality will allow our customers to self-enroll in the various reports we offer and provide valuable visibility into their devices, usage and cost. On Friday I met with the Amigos and discussed the mockup in detail.  Several impactful decisions were made which will result in the need to go back and create a second iteration of the management mockup.  The primary changes to be made are the custom email page.  In the first iteration we had only two choices and required a waiting period, the second iteration has three options and no waiting period.  You can find the first iteration mockup of that page at&#58; <a href="https://ony9kb.axshare.com/#p=custom_email_switch_page_1&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Custom Email Page, Iteration One</a> and the second iteration of the page at&#58; <a href="https://ony9kb.axshare.com/#g=2&p=custom_email_switch_page&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Custom Email Page, Iteration Two</a>.

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX and Advantage backend redesign - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Thanks again to everyone who participated in the card sort activity!  Craig presented the vMOX findings this week and it helped to drive important decisions about the navigation scheme.  It took longer to get data on the Advantage side so I just started to analyze the results but so far they are consistent with vMOX. Here again are the vMOX results: <a target="_blank" href="https://obyzb2.axshare.com/#g=1&p=high_level_takeaways">vMOX Card Sort Study Results</a>.  Craig and I met with the Amigos to discuss the results and several decisions we made.  Based the results it was concluded that goal of our redesign is to eventually break out the navigation structure into different microsites that all wrap up to a parent navigation bar.  In other words, if you work for sales you would log in and find that you are redirected to vmox-portal.com/sales and are presented with a navigation structure which only includes links relevant to your job responsibilities.  If you, as a sales person, need to see something from operations you would go up one level to the parent and then navigate back down to the Procurement microsite. </p>
  
  
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">Upcoming Efforts</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communications Management - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Next week I will be continuing to make changes to the Communications mockup based on the feedback from the meeting Friday.  Once those changes are complete I will bring the design back to the Amigos for approval and then start developing Kiwi pages for the content to prepare the design for handoff. </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">A effort that will probably not start next week, but is coming soon is the Employee Data Upload in OnePortal. Matt is busy getting the requirements together to hand off for next design sprint.  </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX and Advantage backend redesign - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Craig and I are going to redesign the menu based on the decisions made about navigation.  Then he will update the mockup of the vMOX menu.  I am going to finish analyzing the Advantage card sort results and create a mockup of that menu.  The menu is the first step in a complete backend redesign for both companies. </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Project Kiwi - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">I am working primarily on two things with Kiwi.  The first is developing pages so that the content is accessible, even if the look and feel is not yet where I want it.  Next week I plan to create the text page which includes information on fonts, headings, etc.  I am also still working on the Axure mockup to finalize the design. </p>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Meg)</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Since I have color on the brain this week, here are interesting UX facts about color.  Did you know that Google once tested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01marissa.html?pagewanted=3" target="_blank">41 shades of blue</a> for their links to find out which color people were most likely to click on?  You can read more about how to use color when designing here: <a target="_blank" href="https://uxplanet.org/color-theory-brief-guide-for-designers-76e11c57eaa">Intro to Color Theory</a> and here: <a target="_blank" href=""> Tips for choosing colors</a>. </p>

<p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Also, did you know that Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind?  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/20/the-face-of-facebook">He chose blue</a> for Facebook's primary color because it is the color that he can see best.  <a href="https://nei.nih.gov/health/color_blindness/facts_about" target="_blank">8% of men are red-green color blind</a> and it is an <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-easiest-part-about-designing-accessible-websites-76cd6b9a7ae4" target="_blank">important factor to consider when designing</a>. You can simulate different kinds of color blindness using <a href="http://colororacle.org/index.html" target="_blank">ColorOracle</a>; color contrast checkers can also be very helpful.
