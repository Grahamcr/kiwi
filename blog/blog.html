  <hr class="vMOX tm-0"/>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-50 bm-0">What Did Design Do This Week?</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week Meg started designing the next phase of the Action Center Effort, the Employee Data Import and Data Reconciliation Process.  Taking an MVP/Iterative Design approach her first mockup will show how users will be able to reconcilie differences between the three sources of truth using a multiple set workflow.  She has just begun to create an Axure mockup for this process and hopes to have it complete for the next development sprint.</p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX Backend Navigation 2.0 - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Based on the results of the <a href="https://obyzb2.axshare.com/#g=1" target="_blank">vMOX Navigation Card Sort Study</a> we determined that most of our users would organize the navigation options based by role.  This suggested that users would relate to a microsite layout where the user is directed to a role-based experience upon log in. </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I began the design process by creating two A/B tests which were sent out company wide.  The first A/B Test tested two designs which were purposefully design be polar opposites of one another.  The first design focused on making as much of the navigation visible as possible, while the second tried to hide away as much as possible.  The results of that test suggested users preferred a cleaner look, but did not want to completely hide away all of the navigation.  This led to a second A/B test were one design showed all of the navigation options in a flyout menu, while the second displayed them in a contextual navigation bar.  </p>

  </div>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The results of the second A/B test showed that users overwhelmingly preferred to have the navigation bar.  Therefore, the second design was used to create a finalized version which has an improved look-in-feel over the version used in the A/B test.  The finalized version also has a responsive view, which will adapt down to a phone with a viewport of 380px wide.

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Advantage Card Sort Results - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week Meg took the Card Sort Results for Advantage as far as she could based on our current knowledge of the requirements for the navigation.  It is our understanding that there will most likely be many changes to the links which will be presented within the structure by the time we will need to hand off the design.  If you would like to view Meg's analysis of the results you can find a color coded Excel File at: <a href="../img/blog/june8/AdvantageCardSortResults.csv.xlsx" target="_blank">Advantage Card Sort Results.</a></p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Project Kiwi Look &amp; Feel - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week marked the beginning of the next step in the ongoing effort to define what the Kiwi solution will look like for our internal team.  Our hope is create a solution that will improve the flow of knowledge from Design to Development and to QA.  Meg and I have both spent a fair amount of time considering where we meet challenges in this process (you can even <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=personas_internal" target="_blank">view the personas</a> we made) and hope that we can use Kiwi to help us create a clear, consistent design direction which can be applied to both vMOX and Advantage. We are still working out the details of what exactly what functionality we will need to accomplish that, but this week Meg was able to make large strides in define what that solution will look &amp; feel like. </p>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Thank you to all of you who have seen the A/B Test Meg released and who gave your feedback on for the navigation system for Kiwi.  Ever wonder how designers come up with the color schemes that they end up using?  Meg developed the color scheme for Kiwi using a process known as an Inspiration Board which she paired with a simple set of Design Direction Principles she developed for Kiwi.  You can see both in her Axure Mockup at: <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=color_research&c=1" target="_blank">Kiwi Inspiration Board Mockup</a>.  The Design Direction Principles that she developed describe not only the impression that we want the entire application to give users, but also the impression the colors we use to give.  For example some the principles Meg decided on for Kiwi were Simple, Relatable, To the point, Relatable and Hub.  These descriptive words suggest colors that are calming, rich and closer to the blue-green spectrum, which is why you see Meg gravitate to a dark color scheme with a strong green accent color. Meg then paired that with Accessibility guidelines to develop the color scheme you interacted with in the A/B test. If anyone else would like to give their feedback on the A/B test you can view the mockup at: <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=navigation_option_1&c=1" target="_blank">Kiwi A/B Test Mockup Option 1</a> and <a href="https://zmsbck.axshare.com/#g=1&p=navigation_option_2&c=1" target="_blank">Kiwi A/B Test Mockup Option 2</a>.</p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Data Table &amp; Form View Kiwi Pages - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week was focused on documenting two very common views we have in all of our applications: Forms and Data Tables.  Given the frequency that we encounter them I thought it would be a logical place to begin creating a deep dive Kiwi page that sets the design and interaction standards for a common design component.  The style guide for the Data Table and the one for the Form do their best to not only describe the atomic components of the design and how to style them, but also to explain some of the design theory behind why I designed the page the way I did.  My hope is that these style guide pages can be referenced as the source of truth for how we should display, interact with and style Data Tables and Forms across all of our applications going forward. If you get the chance I would greatly appreciate any feedback you have on these example style guides so that I better tailor the development of new pages in the future.  If you are interested in checking them out, you can view the Data Tables Style Guide page at: <a href="https://grahamcr.github.io/kiwi/StyleGuide/List.html" target="_blank">vMOX Data Tables Page</a> and the Forms Style Guide Page at: <a href="https://grahamcr.github.io/kiwi/StyleGuide/Form.html" target="_blank">vMOX Forms Page</a>. </p>

   <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communications Management, A MVP Story - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I completed the second iteration of the Communications Management Mockup for the OnePortal Action Center Effort.  During the Design Review Meeting with Matt, Tim &amp; Richard today it was decided that this part of the effort would be a great candidate for trying out a MVP approach.  As a result of this decision the product team was able to narrow down the scope of this feature from a nearly 20-page mockup to a 2-page mockup. This is a great opportunity to see if focusing on smaller design/development tasks can help us achieve high quality results, better/faster alignment on direction and faster feedback loops which can help direct future efforts to focus in on user needs.  The idea here is that if we can develop and release smaller bits of complete functionality and get feedback on it we can utilize that feedback to guide the decisions we make regarding what gets designed and developed next.</p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">The MVP version of the Communications Management mockup will allow the user to see the status of each of their reports, view an example of a report and approve/deny that report for release.  You can view a mockup of the new Communications Management MVP at: <a href="https://ony9kb.axshare.com/#p=enroll_in_reports_-_start&fn=0&g=1&c=1" target="_blank">Communications Management MVP Mockup.</a></p>

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox"> </p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">UX is a pretty new type of job, but you can actually go back a very long ways to find its roots.  UX was officially coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman" target="_blank">Donald Norman</a> in 1993, however you can find examples of UX further back from notable advancements made by <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-history-of-ux-design-20592208a336" target="_blank">Walt Disney, Henry Ford, Toyota &amp; Da Vinci</a></p>
  
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">UX design even finds it's way into the most unexpected places, even comedy shows. The video below is a bit by Demetri Martin about Bathroom Technology. In the joke he talks about how modern bathroom fixtures &quot;are solutions for problems that never existed&quot;. While you are listening try to count how many UX prinicples he complains about the bathroom fixures violating.</p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communications Management - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I completed the first iteration of the Communications Management onboarding and approval process mockup.  This functionality will allow our customers to self-enroll in the various reports we offer and provide valuable visibility into their devices, usage and cost. On Friday I met with the Amigos and discussed the mockup in detail.  Several impactful decisions were made which will result in the need to go back and create a second iteration of the management mockup.  The primary changes to be made are the custom email page.  In the first iteration we had only two choices and required a waiting period, the second iteration has three options and no waiting period.  You can find the first iteration mockup of that page at&#58; <a href="https://ony9kb.axshare.com/#p=custom_email_switch_page_1&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Custom Email Page, Iteration One</a> and the second iteration of the page at&#58; <a href="https://ony9kb.axshare.com/#g=2&p=custom_email_switch_page&fn=0&c=1" target="_blank">Custom Email Page, Iteration Two</a>.

  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">This week I got the colors page to a functional state.  It isn't pretty yet but all the content is there if you have any questions about which colors to use while developing for vMOX.  You can access the page here: <a href="https://grahamcr.github.io/kiwi/StyleGuide/Colors.html" target="_blank"> Kiwi Color Style Guide Page</a></p>

  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX and Advantage backend redesign - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Thanks again to everyone who participated in the card sort activity!  Craig presented the vMOX findings this week and it helped to drive important decisions about the navigation scheme.  It took longer to get data on the Advantage side so I just started to analyze the results but so far they are consistent with vMOX. Here again are the vMOX results: <a target="_blank" href="https://obyzb2.axshare.com/#g=1&p=high_level_takeaways">vMOX Card Sort Study Results</a>.  Craig and I met with the Amigos to discuss the results and several decisions we made.  Based the results it was concluded that goal of our redesign is to eventually break out the navigation structure into different microsites that all wrap up to a parent navigation bar.  In other words, if you work for sales you would log in and find that you are redirected to vmox-portal.com/sales and are presented with a navigation structure which only includes links relevant to your job responsibilities.  If you, as a sales person, need to see something from operations you would go up one level to the parent and then navigate back down to the Procurement microsite. </p>
  
  
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">Upcoming Efforts</h4>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Communications Management - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Next week I will be continuing to make changes to the Communications mockup based on the feedback from the meeting Friday.  Once those changes are complete I will bring the design back to the Amigos for approval and then start developing Kiwi pages for the content to prepare the design for handoff. </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Employee Data - Craig</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">A effort that will probably not start next week, but is coming soon is the Employee Data Upload in OnePortal. Matt is busy getting the requirements together to hand off for next design sprint.  </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">vMOX and Advantage backend redesign - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Craig and I are going to redesign the menu based on the decisions made about navigation.  Then he will update the mockup of the vMOX menu.  I am going to finish analyzing the Advantage card sort results and create a mockup of that menu.  The menu is the first step in a complete backend redesign for both companies. </p>
  
  <h5 class="vmox tm-35 bm-0">Project Kiwi - Meg</h5>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">I am working primarily on two things with Kiwi.  The first is developing pages so that the content is accessible, even if the look and feel is not yet where I want it.  Next week I plan to create the text page which includes information on fonts, headings, etc.  I am also still working on the Axure mockup to finalize the design. </p>
  
  <h4 class="vmox tm-100 bm-0">New/Interesting UX Fact (Meg)</h4>
  <p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Since I have color on the brain this week, here are interesting UX facts about color.  Did you know that Google once tested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01marissa.html?pagewanted=3" target="_blank">41 shades of blue</a> for their links to find out which color people were most likely to click on?  You can read more about how to use color when designing here: <a target="_blank" href="https://uxplanet.org/color-theory-brief-guide-for-designers-76e11c57eaa">Intro to Color Theory</a> and here: <a target="_blank" href=""> Tips for choosing colors</a>. </p>

<p class="light-content larger lm-10 vmox">Also, did you know that Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind?  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/20/the-face-of-facebook">He chose blue</a> for Facebook's primary color because it is the color that he can see best.  <a href="https://nei.nih.gov/health/color_blindness/facts_about" target="_blank">8% of men are red-green color blind</a> and it is an <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-easiest-part-about-designing-accessible-websites-76cd6b9a7ae4" target="_blank">important factor to consider when designing</a>. You can simulate different kinds of color blindness using <a href="http://colororacle.org/index.html" target="_blank">ColorOracle</a>; color contrast checkers can also be very helpful.
