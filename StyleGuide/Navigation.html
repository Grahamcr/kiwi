  <hr class="vMOX tm-10"/>
   <p class="light-content lm-10 vmox">The vMOX mega menu was designed to reinforce the Micro Site mental model to our users through the use of categorization and iconography. The mega menu also prioritizes the users primary navigation method, searching, by giving priority real estate to a filterable search bar.  It’s minimalistic design means we can keep the menu fixed to the top of the page and leverage Fitts Laws to increase usability.  The menu structure follows Hicks Law to decrease complexity by breaking the menu into categories in order to increase recall and recognition.  </p>
  
  
  <h3 class="vmox bm-0">Drop Down Menu Interaction</h3>
  <hr class="vMOX tm-0"/>
   <p class="light-content lm-10 vmox">The user can view the mega menu drop down at any time by clicking the menu link or the down chevron located next to the menu link. Once the menu is visible the user will see each of the high level categories presented to them in size 14px Roboto #333 Light text.  When the user hovers over one of the 40px tall by 275px wide links the background of the link is highlighted in vMOX gold (#FFC627) and the icon for that category, if present, is changed to have a #FFF background. The two standard link category icons are the Font Awesome Icons fa-home and fa-star for Home and Your Favorites respectively.  </p>
